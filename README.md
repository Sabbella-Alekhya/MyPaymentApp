DESCRIPTION : MyPaymentApp is a custom-built, secure, and user-friendly payment application developed using ASP.NET Core MVC framework. Designed to simulate popular digital payment platforms like PhonePe, Google Pay (GPay), and UPI, the application provides users with a seamless way to enter and process payment amounts without relying on third-party payment gateways.

Key Features:

Simple Payment Interface: Users can easily input the payment amount they wish to send. The intuitive form ensures a smooth user experience.

Simulated Payment Methods: The app supports multiple popular payment methods (PhonePe, GPay, UPI) in a simulated environment, allowing users to choose their preferred option.

Secure Processing: Even though this is a simulated app, it incorporates basic security measures such as input validation and server-side checks to prevent invalid or malicious data submission.

MVC Architecture: The application follows the Model-View-Controller design pattern, which cleanly separates business logic, user interface, and data processing. This enhances maintainability and scalability.

Responsive Design: The UI is designed to be responsive, ensuring it works well on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

No External Dependencies: MyPaymentApp is a standalone application that does not require integration with real payment gateways or APIs, making it simple to deploy and test locally or on any server environment.

Extensible Framework: The codebase is modular and easy to extend, allowing developers to add real payment gateway integration or additional features such as transaction history, user authentication, and notification services in the future.

Technology Stack:

ASP.NET Core MVC: Provides a robust backend framework for handling HTTP requests, routing, and business logic.

Razor Views: Used for building dynamic and interactive front-end pages with clean HTML generation.

C#: The primary programming language for application logic and server-side development.

Bootstrap CSS: Ensures the UI is visually appealing and responsive across devices.

Entity Framework Core (Optional): Can be included if persistence of payment data is required.
